# Tailscale deployment
# Reference: https://tailscale.com/kb/1185/kubernetes/

# Note: This is a placeholder. You'll need to:
# 1. Create a Tailscale auth key
# 2. Create a secret with the auth key
# 3. Deploy the Tailscale operator or subnet router

# For now, this is optional for local development
